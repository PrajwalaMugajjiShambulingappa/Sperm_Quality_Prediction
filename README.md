# Sperm_Quality_Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning solution for predicting sperm quality using socio-demographic, environmental, and health-related features. The goal is to provide a non-invasive, cost-effective approach to initial sperm quality assessment.

### Data Source
- 100 volunteer semen samples
- Analyzed according to WHO 2010 criteria
- Includes socio-demographic and health-related features
- link to dataset: https://code.datasciencedojo.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/tree/master/Fertility
